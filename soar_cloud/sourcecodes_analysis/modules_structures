Overall Structure:

    Main Grouping:

        Shows 278 total projects/groups

        Organized into subgroups and shared projects

    Primary Categories:

        Shared Projects - Common components used across multiple teams

        Shared Groups - Cross-functional team collaborations

        Inactive - Archived or deprecated projects

Key Functional Areas Identified:
Core Platform Components:

    admin-console - Administration interface

    appmanager - Application management system

    auth - Authentication services

    cloud-ui - Cloud interface components

    controplane - Likely "control plane" management

DevOps & Deployment:

    deployment - Deployment automation

    devops - DevOps tooling and pipelines

    argocd - ArgoCD integration for GitOps

    deployment-charts - Helm charts for deployment

    infrastructure - Infrastructure as code

Security & Operations:

    audit - Audit logging system

    case-management - Security case management

    dso-scan-trigger - Security scanning triggers

    observability - Monitoring and observability

    metrics - Metrics collection and analysis

UI/UX Components:

    widgets - UI widgets library

    xf-ui (multiple) - "X Framework" UI components

    tip-ui - Threat Intelligence Platform interface

    cloud-ui - Cloud management interface

Specialized Modules:

    ai-assistant - AI-powered assistant features

    solutionpacks - Pre-packaged solution bundles

    workflow - Workflow automation engine

    live-sync - Real-time data synchronization

    store - Likely a marketplace or component store

Organizational Patterns:

    Alphabetical Organization:

        Projects are sorted alphabetically (visible in the second image)

        Each entry has an icon (â‘ ) and first-letter navigation (L, M, O, P, etc.)

    Pagination:

        Content is paginated (1-2 pages shown)

        Navigation controls at bottom

    Search Functionality:

        Requires minimum 3 characters for search

        Appears to support filtering

Potential Architectural Insights:

    Microservices Approach:

        Many discrete components suggest a microservices architecture

        Clear separation between UI, services, and infrastructure

    Frontend/Backend Separation:

        Multiple UI projects (*-ui) separate from core services

        Shared component libraries (widgets, xf-*)

    DevOps Integration:

        Strong DevOps tooling presence indicates CI/CD focus

        Kubernetes/Cloud-native approach visible (argocd, deployment-charts)

    Security Focus:

        Multiple security-related components

        Audit trails and case management features

This structure suggests FortiSOAR is developed as a modular platform with:

    Core security orchestration capabilities

    Extensible through solution packs

    Cloud-native deployment options

    Strong operational visibility

    Modern UI component architecture

The organization appears designed to support:

    Parallel team development

    Component reuse

    Clear separation of concerns

    Scalable deployment models
